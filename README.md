# word cloud movie reccomendation 

The goal of this project is to gather information about movies using web scraping techniques. The collected data is stored in a PostgreSQL database and processed using PySpark. A user interface was created using Dash, where users can select a movie from a list and view a word cloud of its reviews. Additionally, a film recommendation system was developed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering algorithms. The films were grouped into clusters and displayed on the PCA axes for visualization.
